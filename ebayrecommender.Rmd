eBay Inc. is an American multinational e-commerce corporation based in California that facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website. Some of the unique propositions of eBay as shopping website includes: -

1)	Worldwide presence
eBay has 23 international sites and presence in over 100 countries worldwide. It seems the limiting factor is only where a seller can ship goods to.
2)	Auction format
3 methods of listing goods are available. This includes fixed price (traditional e-commerce), best offer and auction-style (what eBay is known for).
3)	Used items
eBay is known as a secondhand marketplace in its infancy. In this regard, eBay is still the powerhouse when it comes to used goods because of its breadth and depth of products. 

Scenario Design

1)	Who are your target users?
The company says it has 800 million listings and that 79% of Marketplaces GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) comes from fixed-price listings. As of now, it seems eBay business focus is towards the average consumer and competes directly with other online retailers. This is a shift from the consumers in the used goods market.

2)	What are their key goals?
eBay sees that core target consumer desires an online experience which online retailers provide. Their key goal is to mimic successful online retail user experiences. A secondary goal, more in-line with business functionality, is to provide logistical advances other online retailers provide. These would include, quick-ship methods and standardize packaging.

3)	How can you help them accomplish those goals?
One of their weaknesses is in recommender systems. It is a fairly new adoption and much behind when compared to other online retailers such as Amazon and Walmart.

Unlike other online retailers, eBay listings are driven by users rather than product manufacturers. This creates issues for traditional recommender system applications. As a semi-unstructured market place, eBay’s recommendation systems face challenges that cannot be resolved by standard collaborative filtering techniques. I suspect this is the reason why eBay’s recommendation system lean towards professional resellers rather than the casual lister. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/cwong79/Desktop/eBay2.png')
```

Here is a sample recommender of an Iphone XS listing on eBay.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/cwong79/Desktop/eBay1.png')
```

Here is a sample of like Iphone XS products listed on eBay.

In both instances, recommender systems skew towards professional resellers. I saw many instances of this with other products. Also, if I were looking at the latest and greatest products, I wish I would see the recommender provided more pertinent content. I would rather see more Iphone XS models rather than older Iphones. I suspect semi-unstructured data is the cause of this disconnect.
